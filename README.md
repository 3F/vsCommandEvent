The vsCommandEvent (vsCE) - based on [vsSolutionBuildEvent](http://vssbe.r-eg.net) engine and continues mission to provide flexible actions for your environment!

It also presents advanced handler of most events, but unlike the first it specializes for MS Visual Studio for advanced work with all commands and output data as manager of this.

And in general this also contains all or most action types from [vsSolutionBuildEvent](http://vssbe.r-eg.net) engine. Yes, you still may feel free with different modes for all of what you want:

* Files Mode, Operation Mode, Interpreter Mode, [Script Mode](http://vsce.r-eg.net/doc/Modes/Script/), [Targets Mode](http://vsce.r-eg.net/doc/Modes/Targets/), [C# Mode](http://vsce.r-eg.net/doc/Modes/CSharp/), and more like [EnvCommand](http://vsce.r-eg.net/doc/Modes/EnvCommand/) etc.

Supports additional MSBuild & SBE-Scripts engine for advanced usage. And supports a lot of features for the convenience of your work with the build, tests, versioning, IO operations, etc., ... see the documentation

Works on the similar Event-Actions model, and is ready for anything for what you need.
